// MOngo Db ---- Mongo db is a no relational/ no sql database


SQL - structured query language 

to use mongo db what is the benefit we need not learn any query language 

for example 

Slect * from table name where email =] "Ashu.lekhi"
Insert "ashu" 22324 ashulekhi@fynd.acedemy trainer into employees(name, id , email , role)


Mongo db does not follow and query langugae so thats why we call it as NO SQL database 

Then what do mongo db use 

MOngo db uses objects to stored in itself 


From  CLient/froentends Api receive json()
The json received from clients/froentends can be directly stores into mongodb without any other overhead 


MOngodb by default do  not have any schema /strucure that means if any record is having 4 fields that can be stored into db and with 40 fields acan also be store into db 



Lets understand Architecture 
MONGOD Server -   list of databses 

mmt  - makemytrip --- hotels , flights , trains , busses , packages etcetc 

these can be considered as collections 

in sql database grouing of records is known as tables 
in mongodb we call group of records as collections 

Examples ashudb is the name of database 
it can have various collections 
users
products
orders
cartitems
attendance 

In Collections what do store we store records those records in terms of mongodb is known as document 

that document is nothing but objects



TO select the database in which u want to were the command is use dbname 

example use fyndnodedb or use fynddb or use fynddbnodeaug anythings


CATCH : If that database is not there , it will be created on the fly

show dbs
use dbname 
show collections


NOw we will perform operations on data 
and data is stored in collections


4 types of operations can be performed on collections

Create Retrieve Update Delete


CRUD operations 

Syntax is common for every operation 
db.collectionname.operation 
db.users.insert()
db.users.find()
db.users.update()
db.users.delete()



To prepare the structure of the docuemt hwta is ur query and pass it into find function()


{location:"Pune"}

mongodb package  -- when we just want to store without any limitations 
mongoose  -- when we want to provide any contraints 

mongodb pacakge vs mongoose package 

contraints means rules or schema 

ruless can email shoud not be duplicate -- is an example of contraint 
another constraint cant age must be greater 18 another can be noumber must be of 10 digtis

We will keep our server clean 
and we will hire aditya for handling routes Humari comapy's ceo is Aditya 

Routes



Node js api is ready ?

Address of api which we created is  == localhost:9000/user/register 

2) to retreive the data 


those functions which handles routes are placed in a file controller 



for every collections we will have one model . that model will be responsible for crud on that collection 

users collection usermodel
products collection productmodel

first thing we tell to this model is that what type of data is allowed to be stored inside that collection.. this process is schema designing 



Request reaches to server. From Server it reaches to routes . From routes it reaches to appropriate/required  index.js 


From required index.js it will go to matched routepath.. Reoute path will decide which handler function from the controller will handle the request

for example /user/register is mapped to a function mentioned into controller which will handle request for  /user/regiser routepath

there are some functions which contains business logic  for example adding a new user into database
